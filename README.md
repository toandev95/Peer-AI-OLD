# PeerAI

This is my personal project to learn more about the application of Large Language Models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toandev95/Peer-AI.git
   ```

2. Create a .env.local file like the .env file.

   ```bash
   cp .env .env.local
   ```

   > These environment variables are all optional, users are free to enter their OpenAI API key if they want.

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install # or yarn
   ```

4. Start with the command

   ```bash
   npm run dev # or yarn dev
   ```

   > The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
